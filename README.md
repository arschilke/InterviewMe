# InterviewMe


## Inspiration
- As college students, we realize the challenge an interview can present and wanted to help other students prep for the upcoming interviews and first impressions ahead of them.

## What it does
- InterviewMe is both an AlexaSkill and Andriod app. It runs through 4 different types of mock interviews both verbally and in text format. 
- In addition to feedback through the full interview, our project also provides tips and tricks and individual practice questions.

## How we built it
- We used Android Studio and Alexa Skills Developer Kit to build our project
- Built with java, node.js, and json

## Chalennges we ran into
- Learning new languages and deciphering documentation were two challenges we overcame this weekend

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Learning something new and ending with a functional product!

## What's next for InterviewMe
- iOS app to match, recording and playback functionality to Alexa skill, maybe even add AI for better feedback, Publishing our Alexa Skill to the Amazon store
